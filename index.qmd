This project explores the NEV (New Energy Vehicle) Fault Dataset to uncover patterns in key electrical and environmental variables that relate to vehicle faults. Using clear visualizations and interactive plots, we analyze how voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, ambient temperature, and humidity vary across different fault labels. These insights help identify relationships and trends that can support better fault detection, predictive maintenance, and improved reliability for electric vehicles. This project demonstrates the power of data analysis to reveal hidden issues and guide smarter decisions in sustainable transportation.
