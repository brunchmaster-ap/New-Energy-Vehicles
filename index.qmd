Fault conditions in new energy vehicles can be detected by analyzing electrical and environmental sensor data. The NEV Fault Dataset, collected from real electric vehicles in 2023, was cleaned by removing extra punctuation and converting variables like voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, and humidity into numeric values. We found that higher temperature, vibration, and humidity levels make faults more likely, suggesting these issues can be predicted with sensor data.
