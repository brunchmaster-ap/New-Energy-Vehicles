    "text": "This plot maps current against temperature, categorized by fault type. It highlights specific current-temperature combinations where certain faults consistently appear, providing insight into their operational footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot presents the range and central tendency of motor speed for each fault type. It clarifies how faults influence motor operation, revealing if a fault is associated with consistent, higher, lower, or more variable speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram depicts the prevalent vibration levels for each fault type. It establishes which vibration intensities correlate with specific faults, aiding in understanding fault severity and unique vibrational characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows ambient temperature distributions across different fault types. It identifies if particular faults are more likely under certain environmental temperatures, indicating the influence of external conditions on fault manifestation.\nFinal Summary\nThese interactive plots offer a comprehensive view of the NEV fault dataset, revealing critical relationships between operational parameters and various fault conditions. The visualizations highlight distinct patterns in current, temperature, motor speed, vibration, and ambient temperature as they correspond to different fault labels. This analysis provides valuable insights for developing more effective predictive maintenance strategies, enabling earlier fault detection, and improving overall electric vehicle reliability."

    "text": "Fault conditions in new energy vehicles can be revealed by analyzing electrical and environmental sensor data. The NEV Fault Dataset was collected from real-world electric vehicle sensors by a third-party research source in 2023. We cleaned the data by removing extra punctuation and converting key variables like voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, ambient temperature, and humidity into numeric values for analysis. Our findings suggest that vehicles with higher temperature, vibration, or humidity readings are more likely to show fault conditions, which can potentially be predicted using sensor data."
