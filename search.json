    "text": "Fault conditions in new energy vehicles can be detected by analyzing electrical and environmental sensor data. The NEV Fault Dataset, collected from real electric vehicles in 2023, was cleaned by removing extra punctuation and converting variables like voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, and humidity into numeric values. We found that higher temperature, vibration, and humidity levels make faults more likely, suggesting these issues can be predicted with sensor data."

    "text": "This project examines faults in New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) using real-world data and interactive visuals. By analyzing patterns, frequencies, and correlations, it aims to uncover insights to improve maintenance and support better NEV design. The visualizations make complex fault data easier to explore and understand, highlighting common issues in electric and hybrid vehicles. This resource is intended for researchers, engineers, and anyone interested in the technical side of cleaner transportation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot maps current against temperature, categorized by fault type. It highlights specific current-temperature combinations where certain faults consistently appear, providing insight into their operational footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot presents the range and central tendency of motor speed for each fault type. It clarifies how faults influence motor operation, revealing if a fault is associated with consistent, higher, lower, or more variable speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram depicts the prevalent vibration levels for each fault type. It establishes which vibration intensities correlate with specific faults, aiding in understanding fault severity and unique vibrational characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows ambient temperature distributions across different fault types. It identifies if particular faults are more likely under certain environmental temperatures, indicating the influence of external conditions on fault manifestation.\nFinal Summary\nThese interactive plots show key relationships in the NEV fault dataset, highlighting how factors like current, temperature, motor speed, vibration, and ambient temperature relate to different faults. This helps reveal patterns that can support better predictive maintenance, earlier fault detection, and improved electric vehicle reliability."
