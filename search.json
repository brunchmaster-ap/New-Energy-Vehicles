You can zoom, pan, and hover to explore patterns in the dataset.\nInteractive Box Plot: Motor Speed over Temperature by Fault Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis animated line plot reveals the relationship between motor speed and temperature for each fault label, cycling through fault types so you can see how behavior changes.\nInteractive Histogram: Distribution of Vibration (g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive histogram shows the distribution of vibration intensity for different fault labels, letting you compare how vibration varies with fault type.\nInteractive Scatter Plot: Ambient Temperature vs Humidity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive scatter plot shows how ambient temperature and humidity measurements vary for each fault label. By exploring this plot, you can spot possible clusters or trends that might reveal how environmental conditions relate to different fault scenarios.\nFinal Summary\nThese interactive and animated plots provide a clear overview of how the main factors in the NEV fault dataset relate to each other. By visualizing voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, ambient temperature, and humidity alongside fault labels, we can spot trends and clusters that may reveal how faults develop under different conditions. Together, these insights can help support better monitoring, fault detection, and maintenance planning for electric vehicles."
