# NEV Fault Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Fault Dataset, which contains electrical and environmental sensor data collected from real-world electric vehicles. The goal is to explore patterns in voltage, current, motor speed, temperature, vibration, ambient temperature, and humidity that relate to different fault labels. Through interactive and static visualizations, this analysis helps identify key factors that can indicate vehicle faults and support better monitoring and maintenance strategies.
